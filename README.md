# Dodge Verification





This project uses Nextcord, a variation of discord.py. Nextcord works with Python 3.8 or higher. Support for earlier versions of Python is not provided. Python 2.7 or lower is not supported. Python 3.7 or lower is not supported.

## Quick startup:
### 1) Initially, make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. Any version of Python 3.8 or above will work.
### 2) Follow steps on the [Nextcord documentation page](https://docs.nextcord.dev/en/stable/intro.html)
### 3) Most of the time, you will need to install the additional packages from the imports section. You can either go through each one painstakingly, or (this is obviously the better option ðŸ˜Ž) just run the program and see what breaks. The command to add the missing packages is just "pip3 install (name of the package that is giving you trouble)"
### 4) Make sure you follow steps from line 46-86.
### 5) Once you have all the required packages, run the program by either right clicking on the "Dodge Verification.py" file in your File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac) or alternatively on Linux, use the "cd" command to navigate to the directory that the file is in and run "python3 Dodge Verification.py"
### 6) After you successfully get the bot running (it will show in your terminal/console "Socket Online"), you need to go in your channel and run both /verifymessage and /refresh
### SIDE NOTE) The button from /refresh will need to be, well, refreshed about every 5 minutes
